Implement `Rect` and `Square` following these requirements:

 * Instances of `Rect` should have attributes `width` and `height`
 * Instances of` Square` should have an attribute `side`
 * Calling `.area()` should return the correct area
 * Calling `.scale(factor)` should scale the width/height or side by `factor`
 * `str(Rect(200, 400))` should return `A 200x400 rectangle`
 * `str(Square(400))` should return `A 400-sided square`
 * `repr(Rect(200, 400))` should return `Rect(200x400)`
 * `repr(Square(400))` should return `Square(400)`

Keep in mind that all functions, except `scale`, need to `return` (and not `print`) anything.
